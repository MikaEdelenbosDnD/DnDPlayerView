# Items
## Haemstrike
*Weapon (any hammer), uncommon (optional attunement)*

---
> # Haemstrike
> ![[Haemstrike Public.png | 300]]

This weapon is naturally attracted to foes bearing ferrous metals, allowing it to strike them with more force. Those who align themselves more closely with the weapon are granted the ability to manipulate gravity, telekinetically pulling creatures and objects into range of its jagged-faced swings. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon against targets made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armour. 
*Optional Attunement.* 
If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Attraction property. When you activate a property granted by this optional attunement, roll a d4. On a 1, haemstrike’s optional attunement properties can’t be activated until the next dawn. 
*Attraction.*
As a bonus action, you can point haemstrike at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target is an object that weighs less than 300 pounds, the object is pulled up to 15 feet towards you. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet straight towards you. If the creature is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armour, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. Large or larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.

**Rare variant**
The weapon has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If the target is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armour, increase the bonus to +3. Increase the DC to 15, the maximum weight of a target object to 600 pounds, and the size at which a target creature automatically succeeds on its check to Huge or larger. The weapon gains the Magnetic Shockwave optional attunement property. 
*Magnetic Shockwave.*
Once per turn when you hit a target with haemstrike, you can cause an eruption of supercooled magnetite shards. Each creature other than you within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Creatures made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armour have disadvantage on this saving throw.

**Very rare variant** 
The weapon has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If the target is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armour, increase the bonus to +3. Increase the DC to 16, the maximum weight of a target object to 1000 pounds, and the size at which a target creature automatically succeeds on its check to Gargantuan or larger. The weapon gains the Dragon’s Roar and Magnetic Shockwave optional attunement properties. 
*Dragon’s Roar*
While holding haemstrike, you can use a bonus action to make it release an intimidating roar. Each creature other than you within 15 feet of you must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

### Recipe
- Any Weapon (Hammer required)
- 1 Dragonbone (Magnetite variant required)
- Essence (Decides Rarity, Uncommon or higher)

## Haemscale
*Armour (any medium or heavy), uncommon (requires attunement)*
___
> # Haemscale
> ![[Haemscale Public.png| 300]]

Fashioned from the claws and shard-scales of a magnetite dragon, this protective armour can become temporarily weightless when exposed to extreme cold. The wearer of this armour can exert minor control over ferrous metals within a close proximity. This armour has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Arcanomagnetic Repulsion** 
You can expend 1 charge to create one of the following effects while you wear this armour.
- Repulse. When you are targeted by a weapon attack using a ferrous weapon or ammunition, you can use your reaction to cause a pulse of arcanomagnetism to throw the weapon or ammunition off course, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll. 
- Aura. As a bonus action, you can create an arcanomagnetic aura with a 20-foot radius centred on you that moves with you and that lasts until the start of your next turn. This area is difficult terrain for creatures of your choice that are made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armour.

**Rare Variant** 
While you wear this armour, you have resistance to cold damage. Increase Arcanomagnetic Repulsion’s Aura to a 30-foot radius. The item gains the Superconductor property. 
*Superconductor*
Whenever you take cold damage while you wear this armour, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of your next turn.

**Legendary Variant**
While you wear this armour, you have resistance to cold damage. Increase Arcanomagnetic Repulsion’s Aura to a 40-foot radius, and Superconductor’s flying speed to 40 feet. The item gains the Superconductor and Swordstorm properties. 
*Swordstorm*
As an action, you can cast the blade barrier spell (save DC 17), adding any ferrous objects in the vicinity to the barrier. At the GM’s discretion, if there are many ferrous objects in the area, increase the barrier’s damage by 2d10. Once you activate this property, you can’t do so again until the following dawn.

### Recipe
- Any Armour (Medium/Heavy)
- 1 Pouch of Dragonscales (Magnetite variant required)
- Essence (Decides Rarity, Uncommon or higher)

## Shardcrown
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
___
> # Shardcrown
> ![[Shardcrown Public.png | 300]]

From the horn and eyes of a magnetite dragon is crafted this crown of magnetite. The creature’s commanding presence and power over the blood of others allow the wearer of this object to bend its foes to its will. Critical hits against you made with ferrous weapons or ammunition become normal hits while you wear this crown. In addition, while wearing this crown, you know the magnetobolt cantrip (+7 to hit or your spellcasting attack modifier, whichever is higher) and, in extreme cold, you can cast the levitate spell on yourself at will. 
The crown has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. 
*Bloodbend*
As an action, you can expend 1 charge as you gesture to a creature you can see within 30 feet of you and speak a one-word command. If the target has blood, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or instantly use its reaction to follow the command (GM’s discretion). If the creature has no reaction remaining, it must use its reaction to follow the command the next time it regains it. The property has no effect on a target that doesn’t have blood. Commands include: 
- Throw. The creature throws an object it is holding in a direction you choose with all its might. 
- Sit. The creature sits, falling prone and not moving until the end of its next turn. 
- Attack. The creature makes one weapon attack against a creature of your choice within its reach/range.

**Very rare variant**
Increase the attack modifier to +8, the number of charges to 8, the recharge to 1d4 + 4, and the DC to 16. While you wear this crown in extreme cold, you can cast the fly spell on yourself at will. The item gains the Magnetovision property. 
*Magnetovision*
As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge allowing you to sense the locations of all ferrous metals within 60 feet of you for the next 10 minutes. This vision is blocked by a thin sheet of lead

**Legendary variant**
Increase the attack modifier to +9, the number of charges to 12, the recharge to 1d8 + 4, and the DC to 17. While you wear this crown in extreme cold, you can cast the fly spell on yourself at will. The item gains the Magnetovision and Crown of Shards properties. 
*Crown of Shards* 
As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to shoot a shard of magnetite at a target within 90 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack (+9 to hit), which deals 4d6 piercing damage on a hit. This shard can bend around corners and ignores half and three-quarters cover.

### Recipe
- 1 Magnetite Horn
- Essence (Decides Rarity, Rare or higher)
