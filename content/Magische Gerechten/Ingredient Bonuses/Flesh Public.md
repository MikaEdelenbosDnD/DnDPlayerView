Flesh fortifies the body with power. The first attack you make each turn that hits deals bonus damage of a type associated with the creature type of the flesh you ingested. The damage increases with rarity: uncommon, 1; rare, 2; very rare, 3; legendary, 4. 
- Aberration. Psychic. 
- Beast. Cold. 
- Celestial. Radiant. 
- Construct. Lightning. 
- Dragon. Meta; the same as the damage type of the dragon’s Breath Weapon. If a dragon possesses Breath Weapons that deal multiple damage types, the damage type is randomly determined from among the available options. If it doesn’t have a breath weapon, its flesh has no effect. 
- Fey. Poison. 
- Fiend. Fire. 
- Giant. Meta; the same as the damage type with which the giant is associated (GM’s discretion). If a giant is associated with more than one damage type, the damage type is randomly determined from among the available options. If a giant possesses no additional damage type, its flesh has no effect. 
- Monstrosity. Thunder. 
- Plant. Acid. 
- Undead. Necrotic.
