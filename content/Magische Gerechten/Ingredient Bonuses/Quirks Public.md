As with other crafting checks, there are degrees of success and failure. A well or badly made magical meal can end up with quirks—properties that grant additional favourable or detrimental effects. Unhelpful quirks are known as flaws, while advantageous ones are referred to as boons. The greater the margin by which a crafting check is failed or succeeded, the greater the number of quirks acquired. The number of boons a magical meal can gain is limited by the power of the essence used to craft it: the rarer the essence, the more boons it can sustain. A food’s quirks are rolled by the GM and aren’t known by those who consume the food until they become apparent. Cooking quirks are described later in this section. 
*Repeated Results*
Cooking quirks don’t stack; if you roll the same quirk more than once, re-roll until you get a different result.

*The number of boons is limited by the rarity of the meal being cooked. If the result of your check would confer two or three boons, but the meal used only a robust essence (rare), you instead get one boon*

**Cooking Flaws**
To determine which flaws the meal has, roll on the Cooking Flaws table. Unless otherwise stated, any effects last for the duration of the magical meal’s effects.

| 3   | Tongue Tied. Your tongue becomes enchanted; you can speak only in a language associated with one of the creature types whose magical component you ingested (GM’s choice). For example, if you ate a fey’s component, you might speak only Sylvan.                                                         |

| 7   | Allergic Reaction. Your skin puckers into an irritating rash. You must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of your turns or use your action or bonus action to scratch uncontrollably.                                                                                       |
| 8   | Food Baby. The meal leaves you bloated. Your speed is reduced by 5 feet.                                                                                          |
