Blood gives its ingester a taste for certain creature types. For the duration, the first time each turn that you hit a creature whose type matches the creature type of the blood you consumed, the attack deals bonus damage to the target. The damage is of the same type as the attack and increases with rarity

| Rarity    | Bonus |
| --------- | ----- |
| Uncommon  | 1d4   |
| Rare      | 1d6   |
| Very Rare | 1d8   |
| Legendary | 1d10  |
