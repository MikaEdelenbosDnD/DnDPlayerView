Eating the magical heart of a creature lets you detect the presence of other hearts of that creature type. You know the direction (but not distance) of living (or, in the case of undead, unliving) hearts belonging to that creature type within a certain radius, which increases with rarity. This effect can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

| Rarity    | Detection Radius |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| Uncommon  | 60ft             |
| Rare      | 240ft            |
| Very Rare | 960ft            |
| Legendary | 1 Mile           |
