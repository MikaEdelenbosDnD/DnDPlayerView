Ingesting the magically-preserved liver of a creature repulses creatures of that creature type. When a creature of the same type as the liver you ingested hits you with a melee attack, that creature takes necrotic damage. This necrotic damage increases with rarity: uncommon, 1d4; rare, 1d6; very rare, 1d8; legendary, 1d10. Once a creature takes this damage, the effect canâ€™t occur again until the start of your next turn.
