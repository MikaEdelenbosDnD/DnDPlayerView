Spice incorporates everything from celestial and fiend dust to the primordial remains of elementals, ethereal ichor, and the pollen and spores of plants. The effects of spice are disparate, and last for the duration. 
- Celestial. At uncommon rarity, you are continuously under the effects of the feather fall spell. At rare and higher rarities, you also gain a flying speed, which increases with rarity. 
- Fiend. You gain temporary hit points at the start of each minute. The number of temporary hit points increases with rarity. 
- Elemental. You can cast a random elemental cantrip at will. Roll on the Random Cantrip table to determine which cantrip. The caster level at which the cantrip is cast increases with rarity.
- Plant. You are under the effects of the speak with plants spell. 
- Undead. Your maximum and current hit points increase. This value increases with rarity.
