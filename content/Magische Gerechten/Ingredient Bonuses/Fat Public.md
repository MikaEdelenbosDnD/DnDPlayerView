Fat inures creatures to particular types of damage, decreasing the trauma caused when a creature takes damage of that type. Whenever you take damage of the type associated with the creature type whose fat you ingested, roll a die and subtract the result from that damage. The die is determined by the rarity: uncommon, 1d4; rare, 1d6; very rare, 1d8; legendary, 1d10. This damage reduction occurs before resistance is calculated. 
- Aberration. Psychic. 
- Beast. Cold. 
- Celestial. Radiant. 
- Construct. Lightning. 
- Dragon. Meta; the same as the damage type of the dragon’s Breath Weapon. If a dragon possesses Breath Weapons that deal multiple damage types, the damage type is randomly determined from among the available options. If it doesn’t have a breath weapon, its fat has no effect. 
- Fey. Poison. 
- Fiend. Fire. 
- Giant. Meta; the same as the damage type with which the giant is associated (GM’s discretion). If a giant is associated with more than one damage type, the damage type is randomly determined from among the available options. If a giant possesses no additional damage type, its fat has no effect. 
- Monstrosity. Thunder. 
- Ooze. Acid. 
- Plant. Poison. 
- Undead. Necrotic.
