Eggs contain the primed biomantic material for creatures of the component’s type. When you ingest a meal that contains egg, your body undergoes interesting morphological changes that last for the effect’s duration. 
- Aberration. You grow a tentacle that can be used to hold non-armour items, or to grapple a creature, but not to make other attacks. You use the tentacle’s Strength modifier instead of your own when grappling with it. The Strength modifier of the tentacle increases with rarity. 
- Beast. Your morphology changes to adapt to the current environment. You have advantage on saving throws against environmental effects of the GM’s discretion. For example, if you are in a cold biome, you might grow fur and have advantage on saving throws against the effects of the cold. 
- Dragon. You grow a fanged maw, a natural weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to a value that increases with rarity + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. 
- Fey. You shimmer while standing still, becoming hard to see. You are under the effects of the chameleon skin spell. 
- Monstrosity. You grow scales that grant you a new way to calculate your AC. The calculation increases with rarity. You can use the calculation to determine your AC if the armour you wear would leave you with a lower AC.
