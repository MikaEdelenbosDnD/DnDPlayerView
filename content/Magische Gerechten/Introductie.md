Cooking is a subcategory of crafting that allows players to use their downtime to prepare for the conflict ahead in a whole new way. This section explores cooking magical food. It first describes the rules for cooking food, then details the 22 staple recipes and 10 boss-monster-specific recipes, before finishing by diving into the myriad different effects of edible monster components.

**Magical Cuisine**
Like crafting, cooking uses harvested monster components to impart magical effects on food, known as magical meals. When consumed and digested, magical meals have long-lasting magical effects. These effects vary based on two factors: the type of component (for example, eye vs blood), and the creature type that the component came from (an aberration’s eye has different properties to a dragon’s eye). Different recipes call for different types of ingredients; a black pudding requires just blood, while offal stew needs a liver, heart, and brain. The more ingredients a magical meal calls for, the more effects it imparts simultaneously, and the harder it is to cook.

**Apply Heat Don't Burn**
A magical meal takes 1 hour to cook and 10 minutes to consume and digest. A magical meal must be fully consumed within 1 hour of being cooked; if it is eaten after this hour, it imparts no magical effects. The effects last 8 hours, or until dispelled by dispel magic or similar magic. A creature that eats a magical meal while already under the effects of another loses the effects of the previous meal at the end of the 10 minutes required to consume the new meal.

*Portions*
A magical meal is typically large enough to feed one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures. If you have more than four players at your table, consider allowing a single meal to have enough portions to feed the entire party; it can be more fun that way. Checks. Making a magical meal requires five things: 
- A recipe 
- Monster components 
- Essence 
- Cook’s utensils 
- A source of heat 
A creature with all these in their possession can spend 1 hour cooking. At the conclusion of the hour, the creature makes a Constitution (cook’s utensils) check against the DC of the recipe (see Ingredients and Recipe DC table). Depending on the difference between the DC and the result of the check, a magical meal can have [[Quirks Public | Quirksz]].

*Helping Hands*
Too many cooks spoil the broth, but a decent sous chef can pay dividends. For this reason, in place of using the Help action to grant advantage (a mechanic avoided in harvesting and crafting), one creature can help with the meal if it spends the entire hour helping the cook. If the creature has proficiency with cook’s utensils, it adds its proficiency bonus to the result of the Constitution (cook’s utensils) check. If it doesn’t have this proficiency, it adds half of its proficiency bonus to the result of the check instead.

**Recipes**
We have two types of recipes: staple ones which can be cooked with monster components of any type, and ‘boss recipes’ which require components specific to the boss monsters in the hunts in this book. While you will know the most basic ones the higher tier recipes you will need to find or purchase.

*Potency and Essence*
Essence is required for every magical meal; it is the factor that decides how powerful the meal’s effects will be. As with crafting, essence dictates the rarity of the magical meal, from uncommon to legendary. 

*Edible Components*
There are 10 types of edible components: blood, bone, brain, egg, eye, fat, flesh, heart, liver, and spice. Not all creature types supply every type of edible component.  Any unlisted nonmagical ingredients are supplied from a player character’s normal rations, and don’t require detailing. 

*Difficulty*
The more ingredients a recipe has, the more magical effects it imparts to those who consume it, and the higher the DC is to craft it. There are four tiers of difficulty:

| Tier       | Number of Ingredients | DC  |
| ---------- | --------------------- | --- |
| Novice     | 1                     | 12  |
| Journeyman | 2                     | 16  |
| Expert     | 3                     | 20  |
| Artisan    | 4                     | 24  | 

**Known Recipes Novice**

| Recipe          | Ingredient           |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| Keyebob         | Eye                  |
| Tempura         | Fat                  |
| Steak           | Flesh                |
| Blood Curd      | Blood                |
| Bone Broth      | Bone                 |
| Egg Dumpling    | Egg                  |
| Hearty Stew     | Heart                |
| Liverwurst      | Liver                |

*Omitting Ingredients* 
A cook can replace a magical ingredient with a nonmagical one. If they choose to do so, they don’t get the associated magical effect of the nonmagical component, but can still attempt to craft the meal. For example, if a creature wants to make a REDACTED, but has no REDACTED, they can use the REDACTED of any creature (provided it hasn’t spoiled) to complete the recipe. The DC for the recipe doesn’t change, and the magical meal only imparts the effects of the three magical components used: REDACTED, REDACTED, and REDACTED

**Boss Monster Recipes**
Boss Monster recipes confer unique effects in addition to the effects of the components that make up the recipes. For example, aboleth ramen gives you the effect of aboleth flesh (bonus psychic damage) and the additional effect granted from consuming the boss dish (increased reach).

**Known Boss Recipes**

| Recipe          | DC  | Boss Ingredients                       | Other Ingredients |
| --------------- | --- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Aboleth Ramen   | 12  | Aberration Flesh: Broodmother Tentacle | None              |
| Magnetite Curry | 20  | Dragon Flesh: Magnetite Flesh          | Liver, Spice      | 

**Edible Compenent Effects**
This section lists the ten types of edible components alphabetically, breaking down the effects by creature type. If a creature type isn’t listed for an edible component, that component isn’t magical for that creature. For example, humanoid flesh has no magical effects, and thus isn’t listed as a harvestable component, but could still be acquired as a non-magical foodstuff. The effects are worded as addressing the creature that has consumed and digested the magical meal. If an effect puts the creature ‘under the effect of a spell’, this spell does not require concentration, but can be dispelled. The Edible Monster Component Summary table on the next page describes the types of edible magical components available from each creature type
